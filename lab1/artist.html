                <p class="lead">Depeche Mode (/dəˌpɛʃ-, diː-, dɪ-/) are an English electronic music band formed in
                    Basildon, Essex in 1980. The group as of now consists of a trio of Dave Gahan (lead vocals and
                    co-songwriting), Martin Gore (keyboards, guitar, co-lead vocals and main songwriting), and Andy
                    Fletcher (keyboards).

                    Depeche Mode released their debut album Speak & Spell in 1981, bringing the band onto the British
                    new wave scene. Founding member Vince Clarke left after the release of the album; they recorded A
                    Broken Frame as a trio. Gore took over as main songwriter and, later in 1982, Alan Wilder replaced
                    Clarke, establishing a lineup that continued for 13 years.

                    The band's last albums of the 1980s, Black Celebration and Music for the Masses, established them as
                    a dominant force within the electronic music scene. A highlight of this era was the band's June 1988
                    concert at the Pasadena Rose Bowl, where they drew a crowd in excess of 60,000 people. In early
                    1990, they released Violator, an international mainstream success. The following album, Songs of
                    Faith and Devotion, released in 1993, was also a success, though internal struggles within the band
                    during recording and touring resulted in Wilder's departure in 1995.

                    Depeche Mode has had 54 songs in the UK Singles Chart and 17 top 10 albums in the UK chart; they
                    have sold more than 100 million records worldwide.[1][2] Q included the band in the list of the "50
                    Bands That Changed the World!".[3] Depeche Mode also ranks number 98 on VH1's "100 Greatest Artists
                    of All Time".[4] In December 2016, Billboard named Depeche Mode the 10th most successful dance club
                    artist of all time.[5] They were nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2017
                    and 2018, and will be inducted as part of the Class of 2020.[6]</p>

                <p class="lead">
                    Depeche Mode's origins date to 1977, when schoolmates Vince Clarke and Andy Fletcher formed a
                    Cure-influenced[7] band called No Romance In China, with Clarke on vocals and guitar and Fletcher on
                    bass guitar. Fletcher would later recall, "Why am I in the band? It was accidental right from the
                    beginning. I was actually forced to be in the band. I played the guitar and I had a bass; it was a
                    question of them roping me in."[8] In 1979, Clarke played guitar in an "Ultravox rip-off band", The
                    Plan, with friends Robert Marlow and Paul Langwith.[9] In 1978–79, Martin Gore played guitar in an
                    acoustic duo, Norman and the Worms, with school friend Phil Burdett on vocals.[10] In 1979, Marlow,
                    Gore and friend Paul Redmond formed a band called the French Look, with Marlow on vocals/keyboards,
                    Gore on guitar and Redmond on keyboards. In March 1980, Clarke, Gore and Fletcher formed a band
                    called Composition of Sound, with Clarke on vocals/guitar, Gore on keyboards and Fletcher on bass.

                    Soon after the formation of Composition of Sound, Clarke heard Wirral band Orchestral Manoeuvres in
                    the Dark (OMD), whose output inspired him to make electronic music.[11][12] Along with OMD, other
                    early influences included the Human League, Daniel Miller and Fad Gadget.[13] Clarke and Fletcher
                    switched to synthesisers, working odd jobs in order to buy the instruments, or borrowing them from
                    friends. Dave Gahan joined the band in 1980 after Clarke heard him perform at a local Scout hut jam
                    session, singing a rendition of David Bowie's "Heroes",[14] and Depeche Mode was born. Gahan's and
                    Gore's favourite artists included Sparks, Siouxsie and the Banshees,[15] Cabaret Voltaire, Talking
                    Heads and Iggy Pop.[16] Gahan's persona onstage was influenced by Dave Vanian, frontman of The
                    Damned.[17]

                    When explaining the choice for the new name, taken from French fashion magazine Dépêche mode,[18]
                    Gore said, "It means hurried fashion or fashion dispatch. I like the sound of that."[19] However,
                    the magazine's name (and hence the band's) is "Fashion News" or "Fashion Update"[20] (dépêche,
                    "dispatch" or "news report", from Old French despesche/despeche, and mode or "fashion").

                    Gore recalled that the first time the band played as Depeche Mode was a school gig in May 1980.[21]
                    There is a plaque commemorating the gig at the James Hornsby School in Basildon, where Gore and
                    Fletcher were pupils. The band made their recording debut in 1980 on the Some Bizzare Album with the
                    song "Photographic", later re-recorded for their debut album Speak & Spell.

                    The band made a demo tape but, instead of mailing the tape to record companies, they would go in and
                    personally deliver it. They would demand the companies play it; according to Dave Gahan, "most of
                    them would tell us to fuck off. They'd say 'leave the tape with us' and we'd say 'it's our only
                    one'. Then we'd say goodbye and go somewhere else."[22]

                    According to Gahan, prior to securing their record contract, they were receiving offers from all the
                    major labels. Phonogram offered them "money you could never have imagined and all sorts of crazy
                    things like clothes allowances".[22]

                    While playing a live gig at the Bridge House in Canning Town,[23] the band was approached by Daniel
                    Miller, an electronic musician and founder of Mute Records, who was interested in their recording a
                    single for his burgeoning label.[24] The result of this verbal contract was their first single,
                    "Dreaming of Me", recorded in December 1980 and released in February 1981. It reached number 57 in
                    the UK charts. Encouraged by this, the band recorded their second single, "New Life", which climbed
                    to number 11 in the UK charts and got them an appearance on Top of the Pops. The band went to London
                    by train, carrying their synthesisers all the way to the BBC studios.

                    The band's next single was "Just Can't Get Enough". The synth-pop single became the band's first UK
                    top ten hit. The video is the only one of the band's videos to feature Vince Clarke. Depeche Mode's
                    debut album, Speak & Spell, was released in October 1981 and peaked at number ten on the UK album
                    charts.[25] Critical reviews were mixed; Melody Maker described it as a "great album … one they had
                    to make to conquer fresh audiences and please the fans who just can't get enough",[26] while Rolling
                    Stone was more critical, calling the album "PG-rated fluff".[27]
