                    Early in their career, Depeche Mode was dismissive of benefit concerts such as Live Aid. Martin
                    himself stated, "If these bands really care so much, they should just donate the money and let that
                    be it. Why can't they do it without all the surrounding hype?".[42] But in recent years, the band
                    has applied their celebrity and cultural longevity to help promote and raise funds for several
                    notable charity endeavors. They lent their support to high-profile charities such as MusiCares,
                    Cancer Research UK and the Teenage Cancer Trust. The band has also supported the Small Steps
                    Project, a humanitarian organization based in the United Kingdom, aiming to assist economically
                    disadvantaged children into education.[176] Since 2010, Depeche Mode have partnered with Swiss
                    watchmaker Hublot to support Charity: Water, aimed at the provision of clean drinking water in
                    developing countries.[177] Such collaboration led to the release of two different limited edition
                    watches, the Hublot Big Bang Depeche Mode in 2017 and The Singles Limited Edition series based from
                    the Big Bang model in 2018. The proceeds helped raised $1.7 million for Charity:Water.[178] In 2014,
                    the partnership hosted a gala and fundraiser at the TsUM building in Moscow, raising $1.4 million
                    for the charity.[179]
